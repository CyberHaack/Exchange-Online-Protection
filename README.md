## Humans: The Weakest Link in Cybersecurity
Humans are often the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain. Phishing attacks remain a prevalent threat, with cybercriminals using deceptive emails to trick unsuspecting users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious attachments. These attacks can wreak havoc on an organization’s security profile.


## The Role of Transport Rules
Your work as an IT administrator or cybersecurity analyst is essential to the protection of your company. Creating Transport Rules is one practical first step. These rules can be implemented to any cloud provider service that your company uses, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. However, for the purpose of this article, I will be using Microsoft 365.

## What Are Mail Flow Rules?
Mail Flow rules, also known as Transport Rules are rules that take action on messages while they’re in transit, not after the message is delivered to the mailbox.

Unlike email forwarding, which occurs after a message is delivered to the mailbox, mail flow rules intercept and process emails before they reach the recipient’s inbox thereby eliminating the likelihood that the recipient will erroneously or naively open it.
